# üñ•Ô∏è Application Hosting on Azure VM

This section describes how the backend applications are deployed and hosted on a dedicated **Azure Virtual Machine (VM)** to ensure performance, flexibility, and full control over runtime configurations.

---

## üìå **VM Setup**

- **Azure VM SKU:** `Standard_B1ms`  
  Chosen for its balance between cost-effectiveness and enough CPU/RAM for moderate backend workloads.
- **OS:** (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) *(update if needed)*  
- The VM hosts both backend applications and acts as the core processing unit for booking operations and chatbot services.

> **Note:** Each backend runs under **PM2** as a process manager to ensure zero downtime and easy restarts.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Chatbot Application**

- **Domain:** [https://chatbot-sky-shifters.duckdns.org/](https://chatbot-sky-shifters.duckdns.org/)
- **Port:** `8001`
- **Role:** Provides AI-powered customer support and assists users with booking management through natural language conversation.

‚úÖ **PM2 Status (Chatbot App)**

## üåê **Domain Name Setup (DuckDNS)**

To make the backend services accessible and easily routable, we configured **DuckDNS**:
- Assigns each VM public IP a recognizable domain.
- Used later in **Application Gateway** multi-site routing to direct requests based on the requested service.
- Allows the frontend to request backend APIs using these custom subdomains.

## üîó **Next**

üëâ This backend hosting setup works in tandem with:
- The **Nginx Reverse Proxy** configuration on the VM *(if applicable)*.
- The **Application Gateway Reverse Proxy** for secure multi-site SSL termination and routing.
- The **CI/CD pipelines** that automatically deploy code updates to the VM.

_This configuration ensures secure, stable, and flexible hosting for core backend services._ üöÄ
