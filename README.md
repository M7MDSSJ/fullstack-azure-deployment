## üó∫Ô∏è **Project Overview**

- **Platform:** Full-stack Smart Travel Booking System (Booking + Chatbot).
- **Backend:** Hosted on a dedicated Azure VM with PM2.
- **Frontend:** Built with Flutter, hosted as static files in Blob Storage.
- **Reverse Proxy:**  
  - Dev: Local NGINX with SSL via Let‚Äôs Encrypt.  
  - Prod: Azure Application Gateway with multi-site config.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions pipelines for automated pull, build, and redeploy.
- **Security:** Virtual Network with isolated subnets and strict NSGs.
- **Monitoring:** Azure Monitor, Activity Logs, and Alerts for real-time status and incidents.
- **IaC:** Full environment exported as reusable JSON template via Azure CLI.
